Welcome to my GitHub Academic Page! My name is Abhinav Shrestha, I go by 'Abhi' for short (pronouced /ɑː-biː/; अभिनव in Nepali). I am an international M.S. student from Nepal in the <a href = "https://www.uidaho.edu/sci/ess" target="_blank"> Department of Earth and Spatial Sciences </a> at the <a href = "https://www.uidaho.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Idaho </a>. I am work in the Ecological Geography lab with <a href = "https://webpages.uidaho.edu/~jhicke/" target="_blank"> Dr. Jeffrey Hicke </a>.

## Current Research
My current M.S. research project focuses on evaluating methods of detecting forest insect damage and mortality using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-derived data products in conifer forests of the western United States. I am particularly interested in the utlity of UAS photogrammetry based Structure for Motion (SfM) derived point cloud data for the classification and characterization of tree damage of a given study area (UAS mission area). The use of UAS in surveys and assessments has become popular with increasing access to affordable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and increased hardware and software computing capabilities from individuals and institutions. Therefore, I believe that there is a lot to learn about the utility of different UAV-derived data products! 

## Previous Research 
I earned my B.A. in Biology and Environmental Science from Coe College, Cedar Rapids, IA in 2019. I worked with my honor's thesis advisor, <a href = "https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/biology/faculty"  target="_blank"> Dr. Paula Sanchini </a> from the Department of Biology, in a multiyear GIS-based study on geographical preferences of tree species in a local state park. *For more information please navigate to the [publications](/publications/) section of this webpage*. 

## Outside Academia (get to know me!)
Besides countless hours spent working with Imagery on ArcGIS/ERDAS Imagine, debugging lines of code in R, and optimizing model reconstruction in Metashape. I love spending my free time going on a run, combing through thrift stores to find hidden gems, and trying out local cuisines! 
I got my undergraduate degree in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and spent 2 more years working there as a Quality Control Lab Analyst at <a href = "https://www.adm.com/en-us/" target="_blank"> ADM </a>. I spent a total of 6 years in Iowa and its safe to say I feel like an honorary Midwesterner! I speak Nepali as my native language and I am fluent in English, Hindi, and Urdu.
