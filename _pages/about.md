# Research

### Graduate research  

My M.S. research project focused on evaluating methods of detecting forest insect damage and mortality using Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS)-derived data products in conifer forests of the western United States. I was particularly interested in the utlity of UAS Structure-from-Motion (SfM) derived photogrammetric point cloud data for the 3D classification and characterization of tree damage of a given study area (UAS mission area).  

‚è≥ *There are multple publications in the works.* ‚è≥ *I will post as soon as they are available!* 

### Undergraduate Research 
I earned my B.A. in Biology and Environmental Science from Coe College, Cedar Rapids, IA in 2019. I worked with my honor's thesis advisor, <a href = "https://www.coe.edu/academics/majors-areas-study/biology/faculty"  target="_blank">Dr. Paula Sanchini</a> from the Department of Biology, in a multiyear GIS-based study on geographical preferences of tree species in a local state park.

# Outside Academia (get to know me!)
Besides countless hours spent working with GIS/remote sensing, imagery, point clouds, code, and photogrammetry. I love spending my free time going on a run and staying active, combing through thrift stores to find hidden gems, and trying out local cuisines! Recently, I have gotten into the world of GNU/Linux and GNU/Linux-based distributions ü§ìü§ìü§ì!  

I recieved my undergraduate degree in Cedar Rapids, Iowa and spent 2 more years working there as a Quality Control Lab Analyst at <a href = "https://www.adm.com/en-us/" target="_blank">ADM</a>. I spent a total of 6 years in Iowa and its safe to say I feel like an honorary Midwesterner! I speak Nepali as my native language and I am fluent in English, Hindi, and Urdu.
