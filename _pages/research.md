## Current Research  

### M.S. Project @University of Idaho: 

MS Thesis title: *Combining multispectral and three-dimensional data from drone imagery to detect forest insect damage: an evaluation of a novel approach in the northern Rocky Mountains*

Project description: My current M.S. research project focused on evaluating methods of detecting forest insect damage and mortality using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-derived data products in conifer forests of the western United States. Specifically, in the utlity of point cloud data derived from Structure for Motion (SfM) for the classification and characterization of vertical tree damage of a UAS mission area. I used tools such as ArcGIS Pro, Agisoft Metashape, CloudCompare, and R and Python programming to create new algorithms and establish a novel methodology.   

Drone data used for this MS thesis was collected for a broader project assessing tree damage funded by the NASA Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Program (NASA CSDA, award #80NSSC21K115) (*see ['Collaborative Research'](#collaborative-research) section below*).  

> **The research for this project was conducted in the ancestral homelands of the Ksanka (Kootenai), Ql̓ispé (Pend d’Oreille), and Sélish (Salish) tribes of western Montana.**

A DJI Matrice 210 drone equipped with a <a href="https://support.micasense.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011389334-RedEdge-MX-Integration-Guide" target="_blank">MicaSense RedEdge-MX sensor</a> (5-band calibrated sensor) from Washington State University's <a href = "https://labs.wsu.edu/meddenslab/" target="_blank">Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Lab</a> (*research partners*) was used for imagery acquisition. UAS image acquisition mission was planned and operated by <a href="https://atstahl.github.io/">Dr. Amanda Stahl</a>. Here is a sneak peek of the UAS-photogrammetry derived point cloud data I am working with (*data is displayed on CloudCompare*):

## Previous Research 

### GIS-based study of topographical preference of common tree species in Palisades-Kepler State Park, IA 
(*Senior Honors Thesis, Coe College, Cedar Rapids, IA, 2019*)

Abstract: 
The study seeks to develop an understanding of the topographic characteristics that influence tree species composition of upland forests at Palisades-Kepler State Park, Linn County, Iowa. The role of Quercus alba, white oak, is a focus of this study. 123 plots containing 706 trees were sampled with the use of GPS receivers and field methods in the summer of 2017. The sampled field data were combined with its respective GPS data, and mapped on Digital Elevation Model imagery. Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses are used to develop a model of sites suitable for oak regeneration and maintenance within this forest.
