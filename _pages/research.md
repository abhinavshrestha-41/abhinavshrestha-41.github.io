## Current Research  

### M.S. Project @University of Idaho: 

MS Thesis title: *Combining multispectral and three-dimensional data from drone imagery to detect forest insect damage: an evaluation of a novel approach in the northern Rocky Mountains*

Project description: My current M.S. research project focuses on evaluating methods of detecting forest insect damage and mortality using Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-derived data products in conifer forests of the western United States. I am particularly interested in the utlity of UAS photogrammetry based point cloud data derived from Structure for Motion (SfM) for the classification and characterization of tree damage of a UAS mission area.  

*I am currently developing the manuscript for my project and I plan to share findings and data as soon as they are ready and available!*

Drone data used for this MS thesis was collected for a broader project assessing tree damage funded by the NASA Commercial SmallSat Data Acquisition Program (NASA CSDA, award #80NSSC21K115) (*see ['Collaborative Research'](#collaborative-research) section below*). A DJI Matrice 210 drone equipped with a <a href="https://support.micasense.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011389334-RedEdge-MX-Integration-Guide" target="_blank">MicaSense RedEdge-MX sensor</a> (5-band calibrated sensor) from Washington State University's <a href = "https://labs.wsu.edu/meddenslab/" target="_blank">Forest Ecosystem Dynamics Lab</a> (*research partners*) was used for imagery acquisition. UAS image acquisition mission was planned and operated by <a href="https://atstahl.github.io/">Dr. Amanda Stahl</a>. Here is a sneak peek of the UAS-photogrammetry derived point cloud data I am working with (*data is displayed on CloudCompare*):

Additionally, here is an interesting way to investigate the utility of point cloud data in remote sensing of forests: [https://rpubs.com/abhinav-shrestha/979241](https://rpubs.com/abhinav-shrestha/979241). This Rpubs webpage is a part of a final project for the R-programming in environmental science course at University of Idaho (ENVS 511), the analyses are not in depth as the final project was constrained by the limited time frame of the semester.

We evaluated the utility of drone imagery-derived data in estimating shrub canopy volume and compared it to field-based methods. We also established a proof-of-concept workflow for automated shrub detection and crown delineation by modifying programming tools currently available for forest-based remote sensing. My role in this research project were estimating the shrub volume from the drone data and establishing programming works using my experience with point cloud data and forestry-based remote sensing tools and techniques.

## Previous Research 

### GIS-based study of topographical preference of common tree species in Palisades-Kepler State Park, IA 
(*Senior Honors Thesis, Coe College, Cedar Rapids, IA, 2019*)

Abstract: 
The study seeks to develop an understanding of the topographic characteristics that influence tree species composition of upland forests at Palisades-Kepler State Park, Linn County, Iowa. The role of Quercus alba, white oak, is a focus of this study. 123 plots containing 706 trees were sampled with the use of GPS receivers and field methods in the summer of 2017. The sampled field data were combined with its respective GPS data, and mapped on Digital Elevation Model imagery. Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses are used to develop a model of sites suitable for oak regeneration and maintenance within this forest.
