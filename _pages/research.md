## Previous Research 

### GIS-based study of topographical preference of common tree species in Palisades-Kepler State Park, IA (*Senior Honors Thesis, 2019*)

Abstract: 
The study seeks to develop an understanding of the topographic characteristics that influence tree species composition of upland forests at Palisades-Kepler State Park, Linn County, Iowa. The role of Quercus alba, white oak, is a focus of this study. 123 plots containing 706 trees were sampled with the use of GPS receivers and field methods in the summer of 2017. The sampled field data were combined with its respective GPS data, and mapped on Digital Elevation Model imagery. Geographic Information System (GIS) analyses are used to develop a model of sites suitable for oak regeneration and maintenance within this forest.
